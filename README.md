# 🌾 Crop Production, Yield, and Price Prediction

This project is a Flask-based web application that predicts:
- ✅ Crop production (quantity)
- ✅ Crop yield (kg/hectare)
- ✅ Crop price (₹/quintal)

It supports prediction for major crops like Groundnut, Maize, Rice, Soyabean, Sunflower, and Wheat using machine learning models trained in Python.

## 🚀 Features

- Predict crop yield using input features like area and season
- Predict crop price using trained regression models
- Simple login system with SQLite
- Interactive web interface using Flask and HTML templates

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Flask
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- HTML/CSS (Jinja Templates)
- SQLite (for login)

---

## 🧠 ML Models

- `.pkl` files for trained price and yield models (Random Forest, Linear Regression)
- Models are stored in the `models/` directory
